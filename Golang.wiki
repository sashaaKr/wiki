{{{go

var x = [3]int{10, 20, 30}

}}}

Earlier I said that arrays in Go are rarely used explicitly. 
This is because they come with an unusual limitation: Go considers the size of
the array to be part of the type of the array. This makes an array that’s 
declared to be [3]int a different type from an array that’s declared to 
be [4]int. This also means that you cannot use a variable to specify the size 
of an array, because types must be resolved at compile time, not at runtime.

What’s more, you can’t use a type conversion to convert arrays of different 
sizes to identical types. Because you can’t convert arrays of different sizes 
into each other, you can’t write a function that works with arrays of any size 
and you can’t assign arrays of different sizes to the same variable.

=== Slices ===
{{{go
var x = []int{10, 20, 30}

// add variables to slice
var x []int
x = append(x, 10)
// append more that one value
x = append(x, 5, 6, 7)
// merge 2 slices
y := []int{20, 30, 40}
x = append(x, y...)
}}}

What makes slices so useful is that the length is not part of the type for a 
slice. This removes the limitations of arrays. We can write a single function 
that processes slices of any size
