Nice trick by Avital regarding how to use entrypoints:
For example we wanna run some kind of base entrypoint and then run service specific entrypoint:
{{{Dockerfile
# Dockerfile:
# Notice the entrypoint is in 'exec form' here - this is important!
ENTRYPOINT ["dev-entrypoint.sh"]
CMD entrypoint.sh
}}}

Then `dev-entrypoint.sh` would look something like:
{{{bash
#!/bin/ash

# Do some stuff ...

"$@"
}}}
